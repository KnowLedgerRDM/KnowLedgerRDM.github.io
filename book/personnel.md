<br/>Dr. Stuart Chalk is a Professor of Chemical Informatics in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the 
University of North Florida. Although trained as an analytical chemist, Dr. Chalkâ€™s research currently focuses on the 
areas of Chemical Informatics and Chemical Data Science. His current projects deal with the machine accessibility of 
chemical data, the IUPAC Gold Book, knowledge representation in chemistry, automated extraction and annotation of 
chemical property data, digital metrology, and scientific data models.

Dr. Chalk developed the [SciData framework format](https://stuchalk.github.io/scidata/) (to be used in this project) as 
a semantic representation of scientific data, organizing both metadata and data in a single JSON-LD file.  Metadata is 
reported in two sections, methodology and system (under study) and experimental/modeled data is reported in the dataset 
section.  Importantly, both sections of metadata are open for any structure of metadata, as dictated by the research 
process, however metadata can be standardized by the development of discipline-based metadata standards, and if 
necessary enforced/validated through creation and application of JSON schema.

Dr. Chalk has expertise in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) and the related specifications XSLT/XPATH/XQuery, the 
Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the related SPARQL and SHACL specifications, JSON/JSON-LD, PHP and Python 
scripting, JavaScript/jQuery, MySQL, Bootstrap CSS, REST interfaces, API design and construction, schema design, and 
vocabulary/ontology development.
