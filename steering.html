<h2>Alexandra Kokkinaki<a class="headerlink" href="#alexandra-kokkinaki" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Alexandra Kokkinaki holds a PhD in Medical Informatics and serves as a Senior Semantic Web Scientist at the British
Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC), UK. She is the technical lead for the NERC Vocabulary Server (NVS) and the product
owner of its accompanying suite of tools.</p>
<p>Dr. Kokkinaki contributed to the Ocean Data Interoperability Platform (ODIP) I &amp; II, collaborating with external
partners to develop the innovative Rosetta Stone translation service, which enables dynamic vocabulary translations.
She also worked with the SWE Marine Profiles group to deliver Common SensorML Profiles and specialized SensorML
vocabularies. As the lead developer of BODC’s OGC sensor infrastructure, she delivered standardized sensor data and
metadata services.</p>
<p>Her work includes involvement in the Oceanids UK project, creating a unified infrastructure for controlling NERC’s
unmanned long-range vehicles, and providing technical leadership in vocabulary development for the SeaDataCloud project.
She was also a contributing author to the Information Management Framework for Environmental Digital Twins (IMFe for
DTs) and actively participates in its pilot implementation.</p>
<p>Currently, Dr. Kokkinaki works on several EU projects. In the FAIR-EASE project, she led the development of the
Semantic Analyzer (SA), a tool that analyzes datasets and metadata records to map their annotations to semantic
artifacts. This tool is leveraged in the Blue-Cloud project to enhance semantic interoperability across instruments,
variables, platforms, and keywords. Within ENVRI-Hub NEXT, she integrates the I-ADOPT framework to support a unified
hub for datasets and services.</p>
<p>Dr. Kokkinaki is a member of the Semantic Interoperability Task Force for the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and
contributes to the Cross-Domain Interoperability Framework (CDIF) working group. She is also co-chairing the RDA

Cellular Signatures (LINCS), Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K), Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG), Rapid Acceleration
of Diagnostics (RADx), and Molecular Phenotypes of Null Alleles in Cells (MorPhiC).</p>
<p>The Schürer Systems Drug Discovery Research Group develops and applies data science approaches across the domains of
chemistry, biology, and medicine with applications in drug repositioning and -rescuing, precision combination therapies,
and developing novel small molecules with specific biological functions and mechanisms.  The research programs interface
data science, cheminformatics, computational biology, and medicinal chemistry.  To make large and diverse datasets FAIR
(Findable Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) and enable the development of data-driven and semantic models, our
group develops data standards, ontologies, and full stack software applications.</p>

<h2>Jim Warren<a class="headerlink" href="#jim-warren" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Dr. James A. Warren is the Director of the Materials Genome Program in the Material Measurement Laboratory of the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). After receiving his Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics at the
University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1992 he took a position as a National Research Council post-doc in the
Metallurgy Division at NIST. In 1995, with three other junior NIST staff members, he co-founded the NIST Center for
Theoretical and Computational Materials Science, which he has directed since 2001. From 2005-2013 he was the Leader
of the Thermodynamics and Kinetics Group.  His research has been broadly concerned with developing both models of
materials phenomena, and the tools to enable the solution of these models. Specific foci over the years has included
solidification, pattern formation, grain structures, creep, diffusion, wetting, and spreading in metals. In 2010-11,
Dr. Warren was part of the ad hoc committee within the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s National Science and
Technology Council (NSTC) that crafted the founding whitepaper on the Administration’s Materials Genome Initiative
(MGI). Since 2012, Dr. Warren has served as the Executive Secretary of the NSTC MGI Subcommittee, coordinating
inter-agency efforts to achieve the goals laid out in the MGI.  He is Fellow of the American Physical Society,
ASM International, and the Metals, Minerals and Materials Society.</p>
