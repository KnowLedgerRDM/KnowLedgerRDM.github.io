Oliver Koepler is Head of the Lab Linked Scientific Knowledge at TIB – Leibniz Information Center for Science and 
Technology. He holds a PhD in Organic Chemistry from the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany. He has 
experience in the area of Data Science and Digital Libraries for over 20 years. Dr. Koepler and his team develop 
advanced data management systems, services and tools for ontology development and curation, and semantic data linking. 
His lab's projects focus on connecting users with data and services.

Dr. Koepler collaborates with engineering and materials science researchers across three large collaborative research 
centers at Leibniz University Hannover, Paderborn University, and the University of Kaiserslautern-Landau, focusing on 
semantic research data infrastructures. He co-founded and leads the German National Research Data Infrastructure 
NFDI4Chem consortium together with Prof. Christoph Steinbeck. In NFDI4Chem he is overseeing the development of its 
Terminology Service, Search Service, and terminology development. He also initiated the international community 
workshop series, Ontologies4Chem, to foster standardization and interoperability within the chemistry ontology 
community. As spokesperson of the section on (meta)data, terminologies, and provenance for the German National 
Research Data Infrastructure NFDI and member of the EOSC Task Force Semantic Interoperability Dr. Koepler promotes 
semantic interoperability through ontology harmonization, metadata standards, knowledge graphs, and terminology services.

for FAIR research data and leading the Legacy Data Preservation Pilot, designed to support Humanities and Social 
Science researchers with closed data projects at risk of loss. From 2022-2024, she was the Work Package Lead for the 
Cultural Heritage Case Study (WP13) in the WorldFAIR Project, a Horizon Europe funded initiative to promote global 
cooperation on FAIR data policy and practice. Prior to joining DRI, Beth was the Preservation Coordinator for the 
Portage Network, an organisation established by the Canadian Association of Research Libraries to foster a national 
research data culture through the provision of services and infrastructure (now a part of the Digital Research Alliance 
of Canada). She was also the Digitization Manager for Huron County Library and Curatorial Specialist for Toronto 
Metropolitan University Archives & Special Collections. She continues to teach professional development courses on

Alexandra Kokkinaki holds a PhD in Medical Informatics and serves as a Senior Semantic Web Scientist at the British 
Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC), UK. She is the technical lead for the NERC Vocabulary Server (NVS) and the product 
owner of its accompanying suite of tools.

Dr. Kokkinaki contributed to the Ocean Data Interoperability Platform (ODIP) I & II, collaborating with external 
partners to develop the innovative Rosetta Stone translation service, which enables dynamic vocabulary translations. 
She also worked with the SWE Marine Profiles group to deliver Common SensorML Profiles and specialized SensorML 
vocabularies. As the lead developer of BODC's OGC sensor infrastructure, she delivered standardized sensor data and 
metadata services.

Her work includes involvement in the Oceanids UK project, creating a unified infrastructure for controlling NERC’s 
unmanned long-range vehicles, and providing technical leadership in vocabulary development for the SeaDataCloud project.
She was also a contributing author to the Information Management Framework for Environmental Digital Twins (IMFe for 
DTs) and actively participates in its pilot implementation.

Currently, Dr. Kokkinaki works on several EU projects. In the FAIR-EASE project, she led the development of the 
Semantic Analyzer (SA), a tool that analyzes datasets and metadata records to map their annotations to semantic 
artifacts. This tool is leveraged in the Blue-Cloud project to enhance semantic interoperability across instruments, 
variables, platforms, and keywords. Within ENVRI-Hub NEXT, she integrates the I-ADOPT framework to support a unified
hub for datasets and services.

Dr. Kokkinaki is a member of the Semantic Interoperability Task Force for the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and 
contributes to the Cross-Domain Interoperability Framework (CDIF) working group. She is also co-chairing the RDA 
Vocabulary Semantic Services Interest Group (VSSIG).

information technology and scientific content products at Libraria and Eidogen-Sertanty Inc, two technology startups 
in San Jose California where he was a founding member.  After building the operational and discovery cheminformatics 
platform at Scripps Florida to support Scripps Drug Discovery and the Scripps Molecular Libraries Screening and Probe 
Discovery Program, he started his academic career at the University of Miami.  At Miami, he developed the BioAssay 
Ontology (BAO) which has become the de-facto standard to describe drug discovery assays and is widely used across the 
industry.  Among numerous research collaborations, Dr. Schürer has served as Principal Investigator in several national 
and international research consortia, the Molecular Libraries Program (MLP), Library of Integrated Network-based 
Cellular Signatures (LINCS), Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K), Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG), Rapid Acceleration

Dr. James A. Warren is the Director of the Materials Genome Program in the Material Measurement Laboratory of the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). After receiving his Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics at the 
University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1992 he took a position as a National Research Council post-doc in the 
Metallurgy Division at NIST. In 1995, with three other junior NIST staff members, he co-founded the NIST Center for 
Theoretical and Computational Materials Science, which he has directed since 2001. From 2005-2013 he was the Leader 
of the Thermodynamics and Kinetics Group.  His research has been broadly concerned with developing both models of 
materials phenomena, and the tools to enable the solution of these models. Specific foci over the years has included 
solidification, pattern formation, grain structures, creep, diffusion, wetting, and spreading in metals. In 2010-11, 
Dr. Warren was part of the ad hoc committee within the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s National Science and 
Technology Council (NSTC) that crafted the founding whitepaper on the Administration’s Materials Genome Initiative
(MGI). Since 2012, Dr. Warren has served as the Executive Secretary of the NSTC MGI Subcommittee, coordinating 
inter-agency efforts to achieve the goals laid out in the MGI.  He is Fellow of the American Physical Society, 
ASM International, and the Metals, Minerals and Materials Society.
